## Patch

Use this to restore your wallet, then `sweep_all` to yourself so that outputs are visible. After doing so you can safely use the normal wallet.

Feel free to donate to me (for LE CI/CD) üíÄ: `Wo43W51vynJZxCDPMrk9dZ69Bp1kLRrunXAfYBg955f9fQWJZGDThmLBAqQ2UK8i9kRGAnn57y2ntE85tnW3j63C1av7T5cq1`

## Introduction

Wownero is a privacy-centric memecoin that was fairly launched on April 1, 2018 with no pre-mine, stealth-mine or ICO. Wownero has a maximum supply of around 184 million WOW with a slow and steady emission over 50 years. It is a fork of Monero, but with its own genesis block, so there is no degradation of privacy due to ring signatures using different participants for the same tx outputs on opposing forks.

## Supporting the project

Wownero is a 100% community-sponsored endeavor. Supporting services are also graciously provided by sponsors:

Developers are volunteers doing this mostly for shits and giggles. If you would like to support our shenanigans and stimulant addictions, please consider donating to [WFS proposals](https://funding.wownero.com/proposals) or the dev slush fund.

### Open Collective

Open Collective is an online funding platform for open source software and collaborative communities. The platform brings together legal entities that act as a ‚ÄúFiscal Host‚Äù, ‚ÄúCollectives‚Äù (unincorporated, community-based projects), and individuals interested in supporting projects with donations. Fiscal hosts hold donations for collectives in trust and handle all the taxes and legal stuff.

Wownero is hosted by Open Collective Europe, a Brussels-based non-profit that hosts many other collectives, such as Manjaro, EndeavourOS, Xfce, and peertube.social. If you would like donate to the Wownero Project using this method, you can check out our [Wownero - Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/wownero) page.

## Release staging and Contributing

**Anyone is welcome to contribute to Wownero's codebase!**

If you have a fix or code change, feel free to submit it as a pull request. Ahead of a scheduled software upgrade, a development branch will be created with the new release version tag. Pull requests that address bugs should be made to Master. Pull requests that require review and testing (generally, optimizations and new features) should be made to the development branch. All pull requests will be considered safe until the US dollar valuation of 1 Wownero equals $1000. After this valuation has been reached, more research will be needed to introduce experimental cryptography and/or code into the codebase.

Things to Do, Work in Progress, and Help Wanted tasks are tracked in the [Meta](https://git.wownero.com/wownero/meta/issues) repo.

Join `#wownero` on IRC OFTC to participate in development conversation.

## Scheduled software upgrades

Wownero uses a fixed-schedule software upgrade (hard fork) mechanism to implement new features. This means that users of Wownero (end users and service providers) should run current versions and upgrade their software on a regular schedule. The required software for these upgrades will be available prior to the scheduled date. Please check the repository prior to this date for the proper Wownero software version. Below is the historical schedule and the projected schedule for the next upgrade.
Dates are provided in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

## Building from Source

* Docker

        git clone https://git.wownero.com/wownero/wownero && cd wownero
        docker build -t git-wow:master -m 4g .
        docker run -it -p 34567:34567 -p 34568:34568 -w /home/wownero/build/release/bin git-wow:master bash

* Arch Linux/Manjaro

        sudo pacman -Syu && sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake boost openssl zeromq libpgm unbound libsodium git libusb systemd
        git clone https://git.wownero.com/wownero/wownero && cd wownero
        make -j2

* Debian/Ubuntu

        sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libunbound-dev libsodium-dev libunwind8-dev liblzma-dev libreadline6-dev libldns-dev libexpat1-dev libpgm-dev libhidapi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libudev-dev git -y
        git clone https://git.wownero.com/wownero/wownero && cd wownero
        make -j2


## Running Binaries

The build places the binary in `bin/` sub-directory within the build directory
from which cmake was invoked (repository root by default). To run in the
foreground:

    ./bin/wownerod

To list all available options, run `./bin/wownerod --help`.  Options can be
specified either on the command line or in a configuration file passed by the
`--config-file` argument.  To specify an option in the configuration file, add
a line with the syntax `argumentname=value`, where `argumentname` is the name
of the argument without the leading dashes, for example, `log-level=1`.

To run in background:

    ./bin/wownerod --log-file wownerod.log --detach

To run as a systemd service, copy
[wownerod.service](utils/systemd/wownerod.service) to `/etc/systemd/system/` and
[wow.conf](wow.conf) to `/etc/`. The [example
service](utils/systemd/wownerod.service) assumes that the user `wownero` exists
and its home is the data directory specified in the [example
config](wow.conf).

Once node is synced to network, run the CLI wallet by entering:

    ./bin/wownero-wallet-cli

Type `help` in CLI wallet to see standard commands (for advanced options, type `help_advanced`).

## Tor Anonymity Network

### Ubuntu

* `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tor -y`
* `sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc`

add the following:
```
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/wownero/
HiddenServicePort 34569 127.0.0.1:34569
HiddenServicePort 34566 127.0.0.1:34566
HiddenServiceVersion 3
```
save and close nano

* `sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart && sudo systemctl enable tor`
* copy [wow.conf](https://git.wownero.com/wownero/wownero/raw/branch/master/wow.conf) file and save it in same directory as `wownerod`.
* start wownerod like this:

```
./wownerod --config-file=wow.conf
```

* `sudo cat /var/lib/tor/wownero/hostname`
  copy your onion address and share node with others [here](https://monero.fail/?crypto=wownero) and [here](https://forum.wownero.com/t/wownero-tor-onion-sites/623)

To share your node over p2p, uncomment first line of wownerod.conf and add your onion address.

More information on running Tor and i2p nodes is available [here](https://forum.wownero.com/t/how-to-setup-a-full-node-with-tor-i2p/588)

### Access remote Tor node from CLI wallet

```
./wownero-wallet-cli --proxy 127.0.0.1:9050 --daemon-address iy6ry6uudpzvbd72zsipepukp6nsazjdu72n52vg3isfnxqn342flzad.onion:34568
